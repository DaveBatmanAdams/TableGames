A Great Way to Learn Programming is Building Card and Board Games. 

As I learn, I will build such programs with concepts I'm learning.  

This collection serves to document my progress as a programmer. Also, I hope it will offer as example code for beginners! By using games that we all have played before, the concepts of Python and Java will be easier to understand

Current project: Checkers board game with full-funcitoning GUI (Java Swing)



Past Projects:

>Blackjack w/ simple betting system that can be played in terminal (Python)



Future Projects:

>Improved betting system, GUI, and AI for blackjack (Python)

>Adapt checkers game into chess (Java Swing)

>Backgammon (Java Swing or React/Python)

>Simple dice games (Java ==> intended to explore Java's Random class)
