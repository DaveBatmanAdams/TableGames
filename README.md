A Great Way to Learn Programming is Building Card and Board Games. 

As I learn, I will build such programs with concepts I'm learning.  

This collection serves three purposes:

1) Document my progress as a programmer

2) Show employers that I have an interest in programming that goes outside the classroom

3) Offer as example code for beginners! By using games that we all have played before, the concepts of Python and Java will
be easier to understand
